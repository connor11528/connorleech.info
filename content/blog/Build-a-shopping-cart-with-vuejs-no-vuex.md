In the last tutorial we built a shopping cart application using Vuejs, Vuex and Bulma for styling. In this tutorial we‚Äôre going to build almost the same shopping cart but without Vuex. We‚Äôll use the Element UI toolkit of Vue for styling instead of Bulma to try out something new.
The Vue.js only code is simpler to reason about and does the same functionality. Vuex has its place but I wrote this tutorial to demonstrate that it‚Äôs not always necessary.
