I previously wrote a post on testing helpers in Laravel 5.4. Those setup steps can be added to any Laravel app to make testing easier and more effective.

Likewise, there are tools that can be added to every new Laravel project that make debugging easier in development.

Iâ€™d like to especially call out laravel-debugbar and laravel-log-viewer.
